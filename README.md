# Hi, I'm Matias Antunez👋
I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer with a background in hospitality and customer service, I have worked many years dealing with customers and people on a regular basis, I developed and strengthened skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem solving skills but I always wanted to try my luck and skills in the Tech industry and after putting it off for a few years i decided to enroll in Dev Academy. After completing a Full Stack Development certificate, I am transitioning into software development to combine my technical skills with my human skills and a social mindset.

I enjoy building applications that are intuitive and reliable. I’m particularly interested in working across the full stack, from crafting responsive, accessible frontends to designing and connecting backend APIs and databases.

I’m motivated by continuous learning and improvement, and I enjoy collaborating with others, receiving feedback, and refining my work. I’m currently focused on strengthening my Frontend and Backend skills while building projects to strengthen my portfolio.

## 👨‍💻 What I’m working on
- Improving my Frontend and Backend skills everyday
- Building small full stack projects to strengthen my portfolio
- Learning best practices for clean, maintainable code
- 

## 💡 What motivates me
- Solving problems
- Creating good experiences for users and clients
- Collaborating with others and learning continuously
- Creating projects and seeing them come alive slowly
